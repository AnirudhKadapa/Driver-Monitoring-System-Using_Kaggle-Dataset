# Driver-Monitoring-System-Using_Kaggle-Dataset
We are going to train and predict a for different classes where driver gets distracted using dataset from kaggle

The data set link => https://universe.roboflow.com/object-detection/distracted-driving-v2wk5

And for the environment it better to have pytorch-gpu version and ultralytics modules. I have trained the dataset on RTX 3090 Ti system.
You can use google collab with gpu enabled for training the dataset.
